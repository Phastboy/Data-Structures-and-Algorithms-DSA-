# Foundation of Data Structures and Algorithms

## What is a Data Structure?
It is a way of organizing and storing data in a way that enables efficient access, modification and management.

## Characteristics of Data Structure
1. **Organization:** How data is arranged.
2. **Storage:** stores data.
3. **Memory Usage:** It uses memory, though it must be minimized to ensure optimized performance.
4. **Operations:** They define possible operations on the data they contain.
5. **Size:** They are either flexible or fixed in size.
6. **Access methods:** Different Data structures have different access methods.
7. **Complexity:** Different Data structures have different time and space complexities for different operations.

## Goals of Data structures
1. **Efficiency:** Aims to optimize operations.
2. **Reusability:** Quality data structures can be reused across different software.
3. **Correctness:** Mechanism to enforce criteria ensures correctness and consistency.
4. **Scalability:** Continue to perform efficiently with varying amount of data.

## Need for Data Structures
1. **Organize Data Efficiently**: Data structures help in organizing data at various levels, making it easier to manage and retrieve information.
2. **Storage and Access**: They define how data can be stored and accessed, even at the most basic level, ensuring systematic data management.
3. **Data Operations**: Data structures provide methods for performing operations on data, such as adding, removing, and updating data or groups of data.
4. **Manage Data Volume**: They offer ways to handle varying amounts of data efficiently, accommodating growth and changes in data size.
5. **Enhance Performance**: Data structures improve the efficiency of data operations, optimizing the performance of algorithms and applications.
