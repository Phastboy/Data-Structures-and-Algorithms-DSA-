# Foundation of Data Structures and Algorithms

## What is a Data Structure?
It is a way of organizing and storing data in a way that enables efficient access, modification and management.

## Characteristics of Data Structure
1. **Organization:** How data is arranged.
2. **Storage:** stores data.
3. **Memory Usage:** It uses memory, though it must be minimized to ensure optimized performance.

## Goals of Data structures
1. **Efficiency:** Aims to optimize operations.
