# Foundation of Data Structures and Algorithms

## What is a Data Structure?
It is a way of organizing and storing data in a way that enables efficient access, modification and management.

## Characteristics of Data Structure
1. **Organization:** How data is arranged.
2. **Storage:** stores data.
3. **Memory Usage:** It uses memory, though it must be minimized to ensure optimized performance.
4. **Operations:** They define possible operations on th data they contain.
5. **Size:** They are either flexible or fixed in size.
6. **Access methods:** Different Data structures have different access methods.
7. **Complexity:** Different Data structures have different time and space complexities for different operations.

## Goals of Data structures
1. **Efficiency:** Aims to optimize operations.
2. **Reusability:** Quality data structures can be reused across different software.
3. **Correctness:** Mechanism to enforce criteria ensures correctness and consistency.
