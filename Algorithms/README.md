# Algorithms

An algorithm is the step-by-step instructions for solving a problem.

## Characteristics

1. **Finiteness:** An algorithm must always terminate after finite number of steps.

2. **Unambiguous:** Every step of an algorithm must be clearly defined.

3. **Input:** An algorithm should take an input (could be none).

4. **Output:** It should produce at least one output.
